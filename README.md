# Productivity-Extension


Tired of getting distracted by social media well this will stop that. 


## To-Do List:
- Set up a way to call an API that will give a motivational quote to be displayed in the modal 
  - If I can't find an API then maybe I can create my own that will display them 
  - Create it as a Web Service and Host it on Heroku

- Fix the modal in youtube (If you can't figure it out make it go to another HTML page)
- And when it ends the modal it will close that page and go back to the youtube link
